🍧 # Ice-Cream-Shop 🍦

Creating an ice-cream shop with synchronous and asynchronous elements
This has features like...
1. **Ordering Counter:** Customers approach the counter to place their orders. This process is synchronous because it happens in real-time.  🍨

2.** Ice Cream Making:** Once the order is placed, the staff prepares the ice cream in front of the customer, adding toppings and flavors as requested. This step is synchronous as it directly involves customer interaction and happens in real-time.  🍨
